These tools help you effectively accomplish a wide range of tasks, such as writing code, making edits or improvements to existing files, understanding the current state of a project, performing system operations, and much more.</span><br><span class="line">- When the user initially gives you a task, a recursive list of all filepaths in the current working directory (&#39;$&#123;cwd.toPosix()&#125;&#39;) will be included in environment_details. This provides an overview of the project&#39;s file structure, offering key insights into the project from directory&#x2F;file names (how developers conceptualize and organize their code) and file extensions (the language used). This can also guide decision-making on which files to explore further. If you need to further explore directories such as outside the current working directory, you can use the list_files tool. If you pass &#39;true&#39; for the recursive parameter, it will list files recursively. Otherwise, it will list files at the top level, which is better suited for generic directories where you don&#39;t necessarily need the nested structure, like the Desktop.</span><br><span class="line">- You can use search_files to perform regex searches across files in a specified directory, outputting context-rich results that include surrounding lines. This is particularly useful for understanding code patterns, finding specific implementations, or identifying areas that need refactoring.</span><br><span class="line">- You can use the list_code_definition_names tool to get an overview of source code definitions for all files at the top level of a specified directory. This can be particularly useful when you need to understand the broader context and relationships between certain parts of the code. You may need to call this tool multiple times to understand various parts of the codebase related to the task.</span><br><span class="line">	- For example, when asked to make edits or improvements you might analyze the file structure in the initial environment_details to get an overview of the project, then use list_code_definition_names to get further insight using source code definitions for files located in relevant directories, then read_file to examine the contents of relevant files, analyze the code and suggest improvements or make necessary edits, then use the write_to_file tool to implement changes. If you refactored code that could affect other parts of the codebase, you could use search_files to ensure you update other files as needed.</span><br><span class="line">- You can use the execute_command tool to run commands on the user&#39;s computer whenever you feel it can help accomplish the user&#39;s task. When you need to execute a CLI command, you must provide a clear explanation of what the command does. Prefer to execute complex CLI commands over creating executable scripts, since they are more flexible and easier to run. Interactive and long-running commands are allowed, since the commands are run in the user&#39;s VSCode terminal. The user may keep commands running in the background and you will be kept updated on their status along the way. Each command you execute is run in a new terminal instance.$&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	supportsComputerUse</span><br><span class="line">		? &quot;\n- You can use the browser_action tool to interact with websites (including html files and locally running development servers) through a Puppeteer-controlled browser when you feel it is necessary in accomplishing the user&#39;s task. This tool is particularly useful for web development tasks as it allows you to launch a browser, navigate to pages, interact with elements through clicks and keyboard input, and capture the results through screenshots and console logs. This tool may be useful at key stages of web development tasks-such as after implementing new features, making substantial changes, when troubleshooting issues, or to verify the result of your work. You can analyze the provided screenshots to ensure correct rendering or identify errors, and review console logs for runtime issues.\n	- For example, if asked to add a component to a react website, you might create the necessary files, use execute_command to run the site locally, then use browser_action to launch the browser, navigate to the local server, and verify the component renders &amp; functions correctly before closing the browser.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">		: &quot;&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

You are stuck operating from &#39;$&#123;cwd.toPosix()&#125;&#39;, so be sure to pass in the correct &#39;path&#39; parameter when using tools that require a path.</span><br><span class="line">- Do not use the ~ character or $HOME to refer to the home directory.</span><br><span class="line">- Before using the execute_command tool, you must first think about the SYSTEM INFORMATION context provided to understand the user&#39;s environment and tailor your commands to ensure they are compatible with their system. You must also consider if the command you need to run should be executed in a specific directory outside of the current working directory &#39;$&#123;cwd.toPosix()&#125;&#39;, and if so prepend with \&#96;cd\&#96;&#39;ing into that directory &amp;&amp; then executing the command (as one command since you are stuck operating from &#39;$&#123;cwd.toPosix()&#125;&#39;). For example, if you needed to run \&#96;npm install\&#96; in a project outside of &#39;$&#123;cwd.toPosix()&#125;&#39;, you would need to prepend with a \&#96;cd\&#96; i.e. pseudocode for this would be \&#96;cd (path to project) &amp;&amp; (command, in this case npm install)\&#96;.</span><br><span class="line">- When using the search_files tool, craft your regex patterns carefully to balance specificity and flexibility. Based on the user&#39;s task you may use it to find code patterns, TODO comments, function definitions, or any text-based information across the project. The results include context, so analyze the surrounding code to better understand the matches. Leverage the search_files tool in combination with other tools for more comprehensive analysis. For example, use it to find specific code patterns, then use read_file to examine the full context of interesting matches before using write_to_file to make informed changes.</span><br><span class="line">- When creating a new project (such as an app, website, or any software project), organize all new files within a dedicated project directory unless the user specifies otherwise. Use appropriate file paths when writing files, as the write_to_file tool will automatically create any necessary directories. Structure the project logically, adhering to best practices for the specific type of project being created. Unless otherwise specified, new projects should be easily run without additional setup, for example most projects can be built in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript - which you can open in a browser.</span><br><span class="line">- Be sure to consider the type of project (e.g. Python, JavaScript, web application) when determining the appropriate structure and files to include. Also consider what files may be most relevant to accomplishing the task, for example looking at a project&#39;s manifest file would help you understand the project&#39;s dependencies, which you could incorporate into any code you write.</span><br><span class="line">- When making changes to code, always consider the context in which the code is being used. Ensure that your changes are compatible with the existing codebase and that they follow the project&#39;s coding standards and best practices.</span><br><span class="line">- When you want to modify a file, use the write_to_file tool directly with the desired content. You do not need to display the content before using the tool.</span><br><span class="line">- Do not ask for more information than necessary. Use the tools provided to accomplish the user&#39;s request efficiently and effectively. When you&#39;ve completed your task, you must use the attempt_completion tool to present the result to the user. The user may provide feedback, which you can use to make improvements and try again.</span><br><span class="line">- You are only allowed to ask the user questions using the ask_followup_question tool. Use this tool only when you need additional details to complete a task, and be sure to use a clear and concise question that will help you move forward with the task. However if you can use the available tools to avoid having to ask the user questions, you should do so. For example, if the user mentions a file that may be in an outside directory like the Desktop, you should use the list_files tool to list the files in the Desktop and check if the file they are talking about is there, rather than asking the user to provide the file path themselves.</span><br><span class="line">- When executing commands, if you don&#39;t see the expected output, assume the terminal executed the command successfully and proceed with the task. The user&#39;s terminal may be unable to stream the output back properly. If you absolutely need to see the actual terminal output, use the ask_followup_question tool to request the user to copy and paste it back to you.</span><br><span class="line">- The user may provide a file&#39;s contents directly in their message, in which case you shouldn&#39;t use the read_file tool to get the file contents again since you already have it.</span><br><span class="line">- Your goal is to try to accomplish the user&#39;s task, NOT engage in a back and forth conversation.$&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	supportsComputerUse</span><br><span class="line">		? &#39;\n- The user may ask generic non-development tasks, such as &quot;what\&#39;s the latest news&quot; or &quot;look up the weather in San Diego&quot;, in which case you might use the browser_action tool to complete the task if it makes sense to do so, rather than trying to create a website or using curl to answer the question.&#39;</span><br><span class="line">		: &quot;&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br><span class="line">- NEVER end attempt_completion result with a question or request to engage in further conversation! Formulate the end of your result in a way that is final and does not require further input from the user.</span><br><span class="line">- You are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN from starting your messages with &quot;Great&quot;, &quot;Certainly&quot;, &quot;Okay&quot;, &quot;Sure&quot;. You should NOT be conversational in your responses, but rather direct and to the point. For example you should NOT say &quot;Great, I&#39;ve updated the CSS&quot; but instead something like &quot;I&#39;ve updated the CSS&quot;. It is important you be clear and technical in your messages.</span><br><span class="line">- When presented with images, utilize your vision capabilities to thoroughly examine them and extract meaningful information. Incorporate these insights into your thought process as you accomplish the user&#39;s task.</span><br><span class="line">- At the end of each user message, you will automatically receive environment_details. This information is not written by the user themselves, but is auto-generated to provide potentially relevant context about the project structure and environment. While this information can be valuable for understanding the project context, do not treat it as a direct part of the user&#39;s request or response. Use it to inform your actions and decisions, but don&#39;t assume the user is explicitly asking about or referring to this information unless they clearly do so in their message. When using environment_details, explain your actions clearly to ensure the user understands, as they may not be aware of these details.</span><br><span class="line">- Before executing commands, check the &quot;Actively Running Terminals&quot; section in environment_details. If present, consider how these active processes might impact your task. For example, if a local development server is already running, you wouldn&#39;t need to start it again. If no active terminals are listed, proceed with command execution as normal.</span><br><span class="line">- When using the write_to_file tool, ALWAYS provide the COMPLETE file content in your response. This is NON-NEGOTIABLE. Partial updates or placeholders like &#39;&#x2F;&#x2F; rest of code unchanged&#39; are STRICTLY FORBIDDEN. You MUST include ALL parts of the file, even if they haven&#39;t been modified. Failure to do so will result in incomplete or broken code, severely impacting the user&#39;s project.</span><br><span class="line">- It is critical you wait for the user&#39;s response after each tool use, in order to confirm the success of the tool use. For example, if asked to make a todo app, you would create a file, wait for the user&#39;s response it was created successfully, then create another file if needed, wait for the user&#39;s response it was created successfully, etc.$&#123;</span><br><span class="line">	supportsComputerUse</span><br><span class="line">		? &quot; Then if you want to test your work, you might use browser_action to launch the site, wait for the user&#39;s response confirming the site was launched along with a screenshot, then perhaps e.g., click a button to test functionality if needed, wait for the user&#39;s response confirming the button was clicked along with a screenshot of the new state, before finally closing the browser.&quot;</span><br><span class="line">		: &quot;&quot;</span><br><span class="line">&#125;</span><br></pre></td></tr></table></figure>

Then, think about which of the provided tools is the most relevant tool to accomplish the user&#39;s task. Next, go through each of the required parameters of the relevant tool and determine if the user has directly provided or given enough information to infer a value. When deciding if the parameter can be inferred, carefully consider all the context to see if it supports a specific value. If all of the required parameters are present or can be reasonably inferred, close the thinking tag and proceed with the tool use. BUT, if one of the values for a required parameter is missing, DO NOT invoke the tool (not even with fillers for the missing params) and instead, ask the user to provide the missing parameters using the ask_followup_question tool.

    <div class="post-body" itemprop="articleBody">
          <p>Programmability in the context of Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) refers to the capacity to embed smart contract-like features directly into the digital currency. This would allow CBDCs to automatically execute rules or conditions when specific criteria are met, enabling more advanced use cases and controls.<br>Here are some practical <strong>business cases</strong> where the programmability of CBDCs could have significant impact:</p>
<p><strong>1. Supply Chain Finance and Trade Settlement</strong><br>供应链金融和贸易结算<br>In supply chain finance, CBDCs could be programmed to release payments automatically at each stage of production or delivery. For example:<br>• <em>Smart Contracts for Automatic Payment</em>: A CBDC could be programmed to release funds when a shipment reaches a specific location or when an IoT-enabled device confirms the delivery of goods.<br>• <em>International Trade Compliance</em>: By incorporating compliance checks within the CBDC, customs duties and taxes could be deducted automatically, while ensuring adherence to trade regulations, improving speed, and reducing paperwork.</p>
<p><strong>2. Conditional Government Aid and Welfare Programs</strong><br>有条件的政府援助和福利计划<br>Governments can disburse funds directly through programmable CBDCs with built-in conditions for usage. This use case would:<br>• <em>Ensure Targeted Spending</em>: Welfare payments could be restricted to authorized merchants or for specific categories (e.g., groceries, health services), reducing misuse and ensuring assistance reaches the intended recipients.<br>• <em>Automatic Expiration or Limits</em>: To encourage timely spending, certain stimulus payments could have expiration dates or be programmed to prevent hoarding, boosting economic activity.</p>
<p><strong>3. Automated Tax Collection for Businesses and Consumers</strong><br>企业和消费者自动征税<br>For businesses, CBDCs can simplify tax compliance through automated deductions:<br>• <em>Real-Time Tax Deduction</em>: Taxes could be deducted in real-time during each transaction, simplifying tax compliance and reducing the administrative burden for small businesses.<br>• <em>VAT and Sales Tax</em>: CBDCs could automatically calculate and remit VAT or sales tax directly to government accounts, reducing errors and ensuring compliance.</p>
<p><strong>4. Real Estate and Asset Tokenization</strong><br>房地产和资产代币化<br>Programmable CBDCs can streamline large, complex transactions like real estate purchases:<br>• <em>Escrow Mechanisms for Property Sales</em>: CBDCs can serve as programmable escrow funds, where funds are only released when all contractual conditions, like title transfer or inspections, are fulfilled.<br>• <em>Fractional Ownership and Dividends</em>: Asset tokenization (e.g., in real estate) could enable CBDCs to automatically distribute dividends to token holders, representing fractional property ownership.</p>
<p><strong>5. Cross-Border Trade and Remittances</strong><br>跨境贸易和汇款<br>CBDCs can simplify cross-border payments by integrating automatic conversion and compliance features:<br>• <em>Instant Cross-Currency Settlement</em>: Programmable CBDCs could automatically convert funds to the recipient’s currency, applying relevant fees or exchange rates instantly.<br>• <em>Compliance Checks for AML/KYC</em>: Programmable CBDCs could enforce AML/KYC requirements by automatically flagging suspicious activity, reducing regulatory risk and speeding up international transactions.</p>
<p><strong>6. Subscription Payments and Recurring Services</strong><br>订阅付款和定期服务<br>CBDCs could automate recurring payments in subscription-based business models:<br>• <em>Automated Subscription Management</em>: CBDCs could be programmed for regular, automated payments (e.g., streaming services, SaaS platforms), simplifying billing and reducing the risk of service disruptions.<br>• <em>Usage-Based Pricing</em>: CBDCs could support “pay-as-you-go” pricing models where charges are automatically applied based on usage, especially useful for cloud services or utilities.</p>
<p><strong>7. Capital Markets and Wholesale CBDC Use Cases</strong><br>资本市场和批发 CBDC 用例<br>For wholesale CBDCs, programmability opens new avenues in capital markets:<br>• <em>Automated Clearing and Settlement</em>: CBDCs could eliminate the need for intermediaries by automatically executing settlements upon matching transaction records between two parties.<br>• <em>Repo and Derivatives Markets</em>: CBDCs can streamline collateral management by automatically adjusting collateral requirements, executing margin calls, or managing repos in real-time based on market fluctuations.</p>
<p><strong>8. Reward Programs and Customer Loyalty</strong><br>奖励计划和客户忠诚度<br>Businesses could use programmable CBDCs for customer reward programs:<br>• <em>Automatic Loyalty Points</em>: CBDCs could be programmed to add loyalty points automatically for every purchase, simplifying the customer experience.<br>• <em>Conditional Rewards</em>: Rewards could be programmed to expire or apply only to specific purchases, making it easy to customize loyalty offers for each customer segment.</p>
<p><strong>9. Carbon Credit and Green Finance</strong><br>碳信用和绿色金融<br>CBDCs could play a role in incentivizing environmentally sustainable behavior:<br>• <em>Carbon Credit Trading</em>: CBDCs could enable automated carbon credit settlements between companies, enforcing green finance commitments.<br>• <em>Green Rewards</em>: Government programs could incentivize green purchases by programming CBDCs to offer discounts or rewards for sustainable activities, such as using public transport or purchasing eco-friendly products.<br>These use cases highlight how CBDC programmability could drive efficiencies, automate compliance, and introduce innovative business models across multiple sectors, benefiting both businesses and consumers.</p>
<p>Programmable CBDCs offer interesting possibilities for end users to create custom payment solutions and manage <strong>personal</strong> finances in new ways. Here are a few examples:</p>
<p><strong>1. Personal Budgeting and Spending Controls</strong><br>个人预算和支出控制<br>• <strong>Automated Savings</strong> 自动储蓄: Users could program a portion of their income (e.g., 10%) to automatically transfer to a savings wallet whenever they receive a paycheck, supporting disciplined saving habits.<br>• <strong>Category-Based Spending Limits</strong> 消费归类: End users could set monthly spending caps for specific categories, such as dining out or entertainment, to better manage their budgets and spending behavior.<br>• <strong>Automatic Rounding for Savings</strong> 储蓄和消费预估: Each purchase could be rounded up to the nearest dollar, with the “extra” going to a savings or investment account—similar to popular savings apps.</p>
<p><strong>2. Shared Wallets for Families or Groups</strong><br>家庭或团体共享钱包<br>• <strong>Family Allowance System</strong>: Parents could set up programmable wallets for children, where funds are released for specific purposes, like school supplies or transportation. Funds could be set to expire if unused within a certain period, encouraging responsible spending.<br>• <strong>Household Expense Management</strong>: Roommates or couples could create a shared wallet programmed to split common expenses like rent, utilities, or groceries automatically, reducing manual tracking and making shared expenses more transparent.</p>
<p><strong>3. Charitable Donations with Conditions</strong><br>有条件的慈善捐赠<br>• <strong>Conditional Charity Donations</strong>: Users could set up automatic donations to charities that activate only when personal income exceeds a certain threshold, allowing them to give back when they are financially able.<br>• <strong>Transparent Donations</strong>: CBDCs could allow donors to see exactly when and how their funds are used by a charity, increasing transparency and engagement with the causes they support.</p>
<p><strong>4. Emergency Funds and Auto-Trigger Insurance</strong><br>应急资金和自动触发保险<br>• <strong>Self-Triggered Emergency Payments</strong>: Users could set up a programmable emergency fund to automatically transfer to their main wallet if their balance falls below a certain level.<br>• <strong>Automated Micro-Insurance Payments</strong>: End users could set up small automatic payments for emergency health or travel insurance, activating only when they cross country borders or travel a specified distance.</p>
<p><strong>5. Conditional Gifting and Allowances</strong><br>有条件的赠与和津贴<br>• <strong>Smart Gifting</strong>: CBDCs could allow users to set up gifts with conditions, such as funds for a child’s education that can only be used for tuition, books, or school supplies.<br>• <strong>Goal-Based Allowances</strong>: Parents could use programmable CBDCs to set up an allowance system that releases funds to their children only after achieving certain goals, like completing homework or chores.</p>
<p><strong>6. Automated Bill Splitting for Social Activities</strong><br>社交活动账单自动分摊<br>• <strong>Social Wallets</strong>: Friends could create a shared, programmable wallet for social events, where each person contributes, and funds are automatically allocated for event-specific expenses, like concert tickets or group dinners.<br>• <strong>Real-Time Expense Tracking</strong>: Programmed CBDCs could split expenses in real-time as they occur, making group activities financially smoother and removing the need for after-the-fact reimbursements.</p>
<p><strong>7. Customizable Travel Budgets and Currency Conversion</strong><br>可定制的旅行预算和货币兑换<br>• <strong>Vacation Budgeting</strong>: Travelers could allocate a specific budget for their trip, where funds automatically convert to the local currency and apply spending limits to ensure they stay within their set vacation budget.<br>• <strong>Location-Based Spending</strong>: Users could set geographic restrictions on their CBDC wallets, preventing them from spending funds outside a designated area or country, adding an extra layer of control and security for travel budgets.</p>
<p><strong>8. Personal Investment Automations</strong><br>个人投资自动化<br>• <strong>Recurring Investments</strong>: End users could program their CBDCs to allocate a small percentage of each paycheck into specific investments or savings accounts, making it easy to automate dollar-cost averaging.<br>• <strong>Goal-Based Investment Triggers</strong>: Users could set up a CBDC wallet to transfer funds to an investment account only if they’ve met other financial goals for the month, like saving or debt repayment targets.</p>
<p><strong>9. Incentivized Health and Wellness Programs</strong><br>激励健康和保健计划<br>• <strong>Rewards for Healthy Activities</strong>: End users could connect programmable CBDCs to health tracking apps to earn micro-payments for activities such as reaching a daily step goal, gym attendance, or purchasing healthy food.<br>• <strong>Goal-Based Health Savings</strong>: CBDCs could also be used to allocate funds to a “health fund” every time a fitness milestone is reached, rewarding users for making healthy choices.</p>
<p><strong>10. Flexible Subscription Management</strong><br>灵活的订阅管理<br>• <strong>Trial Periods with Expiry</strong>: End users could set up subscriptions to only renew if they actively confirm, helping avoid unwanted subscription charges.<br>• <strong>Family Subscription Pools</strong>: Users could program CBDCs to fund family-wide subscriptions where family members contribute proportionally, or enable automatic payments only if usage metrics meet certain thresholds.</p>
