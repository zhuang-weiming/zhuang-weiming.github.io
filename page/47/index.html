          <p>After a busy week, we embarked on an incredible adventure in Ghana on Saturday. Our day began bright and early at 7 am (it seems nobody sleeps in here) with a 2-hour bus journey leading us to the turn-off for the Amansuri Wetlands, just another 5 km away. However, this final stretch was a far cry from the decent roads we had been traveling on. Our driver had to navigate a ‘road’ with our bus that was more suited for walking or a 4-wheel drive vehicle. Against all odds, we reached the Amansuri wetlands.</p>
<p>Our first adventure involved boarding small canoes, with about 4 or 5 people in each. Our wooden canoe had a few leaks, but we all managed to find a seat and a scoop to bail out water during our journey. Our ‘captain’ propelled us through the wetlands using a long stick to push off the riverbed. We navigated through marshland, surrounded by a river of reeds, following a single water pathway carved out over years of use, reminiscent of a well-trodden mountain trail. Amidst a bird sanctuary, we observed numerous birds and flowers. Our route took us from the vast expanse of the river into a narrow channel and through a rainforest, my favorite part of the trip, gliding through the mangrove forest. The serene beauty was briefly interrupted by another canoe filled with a group singing an African song. We passed each other with high fives, and their singing soon faded away. Emerging from the forest, the wetlands opened up to a wide river, where we swapped the long stick for paddles and took turns helping to steer our canoe. The canoeing took an hour in the 30-degree weather, but occasional cloud cover and a bit of rain made it quite comfortable. I think I’m even starting to get used to the humidity here!</p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/17/ghana-day-16/1.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/17/ghana-day-16/2.jpg"></p>
<p>Our journey then led us to the village of Nzulezo, a unique community accessible only by water and primarily by canoe for its residents. Built entirely on stilts above water, the village is home to 450 people. Upon disembarking from our canoes, we were warmly welcomed by the locals. They guided us down the ‘main street’ and through the town to the far end of the village. Having explored many interesting parts of the world, I found this experience to be the most fascinating yet. The town, primarily constructed from wood, a lot of bamboo, and some rubber plants, extended over the water on stilts. The residents lived in small rooms that made up their houses. We were allowed to photograph the town, but had to seek permission before taking pictures of the people. The village featured a small market and a single-room schoolhouse for children up to grade 6. The inhabitants, reliant on fishing and farming, had to bring in all other necessities by boat. Lacking electricity, a generator was their sole source of power.</p>
<p>We had the honor of meeting the town chief, who shared the village’s history in an African language, translated for us by our guide. We then presented any gifts we had for the school children; I had brought several pairs of children’s sandals for the occasion. Many of us purchased small wooden carved canoes as a gesture of gratitude for their hospitality.</p>
<p>Exploring the village further, we saw a small farm with goats and chickens, also built on stilts over the water, like the rest of the village. Despite its size, the community had three churches. We then embarked on our hour-long canoe trip back, relishing the beauty of the wetlands once more.</p>
<p>Our trip concluded with some leisure time at the beach, located at the start of the wetlands and right on the coast. I roamed the shoreline, collecting a few beautiful seashells.</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary day.</p>

          <p>Seven days were pasted, first week ended!!!<br>For me, it has already been quite some time since my arrival. Today marks the seventh day since I landed in this fascinating country. The next two weeks will pass swiftly, and I’m aware that my assignment will soon come to an end. Our hotel is delightful, offering a splendid, expansive view below us.</p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/1.jpg"></p>
<p>We service for GTB (Ghana Tourist Board), it is located in SIC building. This week we (Anouk and I) went to there in 9:00 everyday, but we realized that we need more time working with GTB, we will go to GTB in 8:00AM everyday.</p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/2.jpg"></p>
<p>GTB (Ghana tourist board) in Takoradi control the whole tourist affair in West Region, they are trying to extend their market urgently to fight for poverty. That’s a really nice idea. we are the first team from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www-146.ibm.com/corporateservicecorps/">IBM CSC program</a> service for GTB. We hopefully help to them very much. </p>
<p>In this week, we (Anouk and me) did interview with most of staffs, 6 people, and two NGO, RC and SNV, they give us so much information. We are getting to know Ghana and GTB deeper and deeper. We will help GTB to organize one workshop tourism marketing and product development strategy for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.ghanawestcoast.com/">Ghana West Coast</a> . It’s really a nice marketing plan for Ghana West Coast  in the future two years. We will help GTB to make this plan to go further.<br>By the way,  Ghana West Coast is the most beautiful beach which I have seen. </p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/3.jpg"></p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/4.jpg"></p>
<p>And we will also train basic computer knowledge to staffs, including Windows, MS office and using E-mail. It seems so easy for us, but it’s really important for GTB. When we did interview with Samuel, he is the only one person worked in research&amp;statistics department, he used his head and calculator to do research&amp;statistics on clients check-in data of all the hotels in west region for more than 20 years. When we show to him that we use MS Excel to calculate with formula, he was super amazed. We explained it for more than 90 mins what it is, he begin to believe it. I really can’t forget his lovely face.</p>
<p>Anouk and I are working here just one month. It’s a small project here, but we hope small project and small project can accumulate to a big change.<br>Will.<br>2010.Oct.08. </p>
