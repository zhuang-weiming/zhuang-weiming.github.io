          <p>How times flying. I went back to China, but I can not forget what happened on my last working day in Ghana.</p>
<p>On the last day, the last three team did their final presentations, including Chamber, GTB and NBSSI Team. The final presentation was very successful, we did a great job and we got a great satisfaction from client, and detailed action plan was created. It means we delivered these results to client, they are not only deliverables, but also they will become a big impact in future. I feel an honest and happy pride!</p>
<p>In the evening, Mr.Hammond and staffs of GTB met Anouk and I in Valley Beach Hotel, they sent us great presents.</p>

<p>We chatted for long time, the most unforgettable sentence from clients is “Unbelievable, I thought you (Anouk and I) are working together one year at least!”</p>
<p>Absolutely, our understanding really more than one year already in CSC program Ghana Team V.</p>

          <p>Day 21, that’s counted to the day of my departure from Ghana on 10/30. Three weeks have passed. So fast!</p>
<p>The most enduring aspect of this CSC (Corporate Service Corps) experience has been the friendships formed. It’s a rare and possibly once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to spend an entire month closely engaging with a group of people, day in and day out. It’s been a pleasure to be part of such a wonderful group, and I hold immense respect for each individual. Being the youngest in our team, I’ve received abundant care and support, not just in work but in everyday life, and I’ve learned immensely.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Roy, Anouk, and I completed the Ghana West Coast Marketing workshop. Mr. Hammond, the president of the Ghana Tourism Board (GTB), was the first to arrive at SNV, the workshop venue. His serious approach to the workshop was encouraging to see. Mr. Hammond also delivered the opening speech, introducing the IBM CSC Ghana 5 team to everyone.</p>
<p>A total of 15 people participated in the workshop, representing GTB, Ricerca e Cooperazione, SNV, Ghana Wildlife Society, Wildlife Division, COSPE, and IBM. Roy, who is exceptional in his skills, designed the brainstorming process. The 12 participants were split into three groups for the first phase of discussion. After 30 minutes, they voted on all the ideas, using Canadian flag tabs as a cute voting method. We then selected the top three ideas for the second phase of the workshop.</p>

<p>Phase one voting </p>
<p>In phase two, there were 10 concrete problem&amp;topics prepared in advance and rearranged 12 participators into 3 groups, then jump in depth discussions on these 3 top ideas. Finally, we got a lot of ideas in workshop. We will organize them in structure, analysis, give conclusions and recommendations in our final presentation.<br>Really a wonderful day!</p>

          <p>It’s now mid-October, and we’ve been heading to the Ghana Tourist Board (GTB) daily at around 8:20 AM. According to our schedule, Anouk and I have conducted training for four individuals in Excel, two in Windows and Word, and six in PowerPoint.</p>
<p>One particularly memorable moment was when I first assisted Michael, my initial student. He was thrilled to learn about the computer’s capabilities – editing words, performing calculations, surfing the internet, chatting, and connecting with people worldwide. His eyes sparkled with excitement. Today, we conducted PowerPoint and Excel training for the president and director of GTB, Mr. Hammond. Having worked at GTB for over 28 years, Mr. Hammond possesses a clear vision for the organization’s future and is a smart, quick learner. He immediately grasped the PowerPoint functions during his first practice session. However, during our Excel training, we noticed that slight movements of the mouse could significantly alter the content. Therefore, sometimes we worked hand in hand to practice together.</p>

<p>Next week, on October 20th, we will conclude the computer training at GTB. Additionally, we are facilitating a workshop, a collaborative effort between NGOs and GTB. Presently, under this market plan, GTB and the NGOs aim to establish a Destination Management Organization (DMO). The forthcoming step involves organizing training to familiarize the DMO with its management responsibilities, which will contribute to the development of the ‘Destination Management Plan for Ghana’s West Coast.’ This initiative has enabled members of the steering committee to interact for the first time, fostering stronger connections between the private and public sectors beyond the conventional licensing and control dynamics. The private sector, particularly the beach resorts, has been structured into an association to represent common interests, allowing for a platform to discuss issues and share perspectives. We are hopeful that the workshop on October 22nd will significantly advance the Marketing and Product Development Strategy for Ghana’s West Coast.</p>

Our day began bright and early at 7 am (it seems nobody sleeps in here) with a 2-hour bus journey leading us to the turn-off for the Amansuri Wetlands, just another 5 km away. However, this final stretch was a far cry from the decent roads we had been traveling on. Our driver had to navigate a ‘road’ with our bus that was more suited for walking or a 4-wheel drive vehicle. Against all odds, we reached the Amansuri wetlands.</p>
<p>Our first adventure involved boarding small canoes, with about 4 or 5 people in each. Our wooden canoe had a few leaks, but we all managed to find a seat and a scoop to bail out water during our journey. Our ‘captain’ propelled us through the wetlands using a long stick to push off the riverbed. We navigated through marshland, surrounded by a river of reeds, following a single water pathway carved out over years of use, reminiscent of a well-trodden mountain trail. Amidst a bird sanctuary, we observed numerous birds and flowers. Our route took us from the vast expanse of the river into a narrow channel and through a rainforest, my favorite part of the trip, gliding through the mangrove forest. The serene beauty was briefly interrupted by another canoe filled with a group singing an African song. We passed each other with high fives, and their singing soon faded away. Emerging from the forest, the wetlands opened up to a wide river, where we swapped the long stick for paddles and took turns helping to steer our canoe. The canoeing took an hour in the 30-degree weather, but occasional cloud cover and a bit of rain made it quite comfortable. I think I’m even starting to get used to the humidity here!</p>

<p>Our journey then led us to the village of Nzulezo, a unique community accessible only by water and primarily by canoe for its residents. Built entirely on stilts above water, the village is home to 450 people. Upon disembarking from our canoes, we were warmly welcomed by the locals. They guided us down the ‘main street’ and through the town to the far end of the village. Having explored many interesting parts of the world, I found this experience to be the most fascinating yet. The town, primarily constructed from wood, a lot of bamboo, and some rubber plants, extended over the water on stilts. The residents lived in small rooms that made up their houses. We were allowed to photograph the town, but had to seek permission before taking pictures of the people. The village featured a small market and a single-room schoolhouse for children up to grade 6. The inhabitants, reliant on fishing and farming, had to bring in all other necessities by boat. Lacking electricity, a generator was their sole source of power.</p>
<p>We had the honor of meeting the town chief, who shared the village’s history in an African language, translated for us by our guide. We then presented any gifts we had for the school children; I had brought several pairs of children’s sandals for the occasion. Many of us purchased small wooden carved canoes as a gesture of gratitude for their hospitality.</p>
<p>Exploring the village further, we saw a small farm with goats and chickens, also built on stilts over the water, like the rest of the village. Despite its size, the community had three churches. We then embarked on our hour-long canoe trip back, relishing the beauty of the wetlands once more.</p>
<p>Our trip concluded with some leisure time at the beach, located at the start of the wetlands and right on the coast. I roamed the shoreline, collecting a few beautiful seashells.</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary day.</p>

          <p>Seven days were pasted, first week ended!!!<br>For me, it has already been quite some time since my arrival. Today marks the seventh day since I landed in this fascinating country. The next two weeks will pass swiftly, and I’m aware that my assignment will soon come to an end. Our hotel is delightful, offering a splendid, expansive view below us.</p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/1.jpg"></p>
<p>We service for GTB (Ghana Tourist Board), it is located in SIC building. This week we (Anouk and I) went to there in 9:00 everyday, but we realized that we need more time working with GTB, we will go to GTB in 8:00AM everyday.</p>
<p><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/2.jpg"></p>
<p>GTB (Ghana tourist board) in Takoradi control the whole tourist affair in West Region, they are trying to extend their market urgently to fight for poverty. That’s a really nice idea. we are the first team from <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www-146.ibm.com/corporateservicecorps/">IBM CSC program</a> service for GTB. We hopefully help to them very much. </p>
<p>In this week, we (Anouk and me) did interview with most of staffs, 6 people, and two NGO, RC and SNV, they give us so much information. We are getting to know Ghana and GTB deeper and deeper. We will help GTB to organize one workshop tourism marketing and product development strategy for <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.ghanawestcoast.com/">Ghana West Coast</a> . It’s really a nice marketing plan for Ghana West Coast  in the future two years. We will help GTB to make this plan to go further.<br>By the way,  Ghana West Coast is the most beautiful beach which I have seen. </p>

<p><img src="/2010/10/09/ghana-day-7/4.jpg"></p>
<p>And we will also train basic computer knowledge to staffs, including Windows, MS office and using E-mail. It seems so easy for us, but it’s really important for GTB. When we did interview with Samuel, he is the only one person worked in research&amp;statistics department, he used his head and calculator to do research&amp;statistics on clients check-in data of all the hotels in west region for more than 20 years. When we show to him that we use MS Excel to calculate with formula, he was super amazed. We explained it for more than 90 mins what it is, he begin to believe it. I really can’t forget his lovely face.</p>
<p>Anouk and I are working here just one month. It’s a small project here, but we hope small project and small project can accumulate to a big change.<br>Will.<br>2010.Oct.08. </p>
